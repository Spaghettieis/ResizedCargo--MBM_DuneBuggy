Code for my mod [ResizedCargo: MBM Dune buggy](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3183973369) 

My contribution is literally one line of code. Not sure how much intellectual property I´m generating here. ;-)
The thing to note is that you need to add the mod you´re modifying in the required addons on top of the config.cpp and 
that this also takes care of a load order problem that might otherwise arise.

Check out [mebrad´s](https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198380632542/myworkshopfiles) other mods, and of course his [dune buggy](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3166659854) which this mod modifies.
